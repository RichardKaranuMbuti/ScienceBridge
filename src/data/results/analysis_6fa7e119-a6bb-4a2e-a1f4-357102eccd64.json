    "The dataset contains 200 records with no missing values in key variables",

      "key_insights": [
        "The distribution of 'mol_weight' shows a right-skewed pattern with a mean around 300",
        "The 'logP' values are normally distributed with a mean close to 3",
        "The number of hydrogen donors and acceptors show discrete distributions with peaks at specific integer values",
        "The 'bioactivity' and 'predicted_bioactivity' distributions are right-skewed, indicating a few compounds with high activity"

  "summary": "The dataset was analyzed to visualize the distribution of key variables. The distributions reveal patterns such as right-skewness in 'mol_weight' and 'bioactivity', and normal distribution in 'logP'. These insights are crucial for understanding the chemical properties and bioactivity of the compounds.",
  "next_steps": [
    "Perform statistical analysis to quantify the relationships between these variables",
    "Explore potential correlations between 'predicted_bioactivity' and other chemical properties",
    "Investigate outliers in the distributions for potential data quality issues or interesting compounds"
  ],
  "conclusion": "The visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of key chemical and bioactivity variables in the dataset. The patterns observed, such as skewness and normality, are significant for further analysis and modeling efforts."
