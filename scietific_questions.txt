Advanced Scientific Questions

Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis:
"Can you identify specific molecular descriptor patterns or thresholds that predict high bioactivity across different compound families? Use machine learning to build a predictive model and identify the most important features."
Multi-Assay Success Prediction:
"Develop a model that predicts which compounds will succeed in all three major assay types based on their molecular properties and experimental conditions. What are the minimal structural requirements for multi-assay success?"
Experimental Condition Optimization:
"What combination of pH, temperature, and exposure time maximizes bioactivity for compounds with different logP values? Can you identify optimal experimental windows for different molecular weight ranges?"
Batch Effect Analysis:
"Are there systematic differences in bioactivity outcomes between different labs or batch IDs that cannot be explained by compound properties alone? Use statistical methods to quantify and visualize these effects."


Non-Linear Property Interactions:
"Using advanced machine learning techniques, identify non-linear interactions between molecular descriptors (like logP and rotatable bonds) that might have synergistic effects on bioactivity beyond their individual contributions."

Cross-Dataset Validation:
"How consistent are bioactivity predictions across the three related bioactivity datasets? Build a model on one set and test its generalizability to the others, identifying compounds that behave unexpectedly."
