“Which features most influence bioactivity?”

Regression / correlation analysis

“Which compounds have high bioactivity and why?”

Cluster analysis + decision trees or SHAP values

“Can we predict pIC50 from chemical structure?”

Train a model (Random Forest, XGBoost)

“Do highly lipophilic compounds show higher activity?”

Hypothesis test: t-test or linear regression with logP

“Which descriptors correlate most with bioactivity?”

Pearson/Spearman correlation

“Group compounds by structural features and analyze activity trends.”

K-means clustering on features

“Visualize the relationship between molecular weight and pIC50.”

Scatter plot with regression line
